This is a demo of rock paper scissors game in solidty.

A basic commit-reveal pattern is used in this DApp. Please read [smart contract best practice: remember that on chain data is public](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#remember-that-on-chain-data-is-public)
for more detail.

## how to use it
* compile rps.sol and deploy (e.g. using remix)
* Edit app.js, replace address variable with your deployed contract address
* start a httpserver (e.g. httpster), browse and open index.html. You need to install metamask to use this app

This is for a live coding demo, and the contract/UI is not full-featured. Feel free to copy/modify it to make a more complete one.

have fun :-)
